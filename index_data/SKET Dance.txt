== Synopsis ==

The manga follows the shenanigans and day-to-day activities of the Sket-dan (スケット団, Suketto-dan, "SKET Brigade" in the Animax broadcast), a high school club dedicated towards helping other people in the campus of Kaimei High School, whether teacher or student, with whatever request they have – completely free of charge.
The club consists of three members: Bossun, the immature yet reliable "jack-of-all-trades" leader of the group; Himeko, the aggressive yet delicate "muscle" of the group who wields a hockey stick as her weapon; and Switch, the tech-savvy otaku and the "brains" of the group who only speaks through his laptop with speech synthesis software. Together as the Sket-dan, the trio take on requests from different kinds of individuals around their school, and no matter how big or small the request, no matter how mundane or absurd, the Sket-dan manage to always get the job done – all on a mission to improve the lives of the people in their high school.
