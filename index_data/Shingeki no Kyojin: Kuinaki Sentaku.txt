Attack on Titan: No Regrets (Japanese: 進撃の巨人 悔いなき選択, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin Kui Naki Sentaku) is a Japanese manga series written by Gun Snark and illustrated by Hikaru Suruga, based on a visual novel of the same name. The series is a prequel spin-off of Hajime Isayama's popular Attack on Titan (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin) manga. The story follows the character of Levi Ackerman before he joins the Survey Corps.
The series is published by Kodansha in Japan and by Kodansha Comics in the United States. A two-part original animation DVD was released in 2014 and 2015.


== Plot ==
The story is a prequel to Attack on Titan that follows Levi during his days as a criminal in the underground city, when he was with his two best friends Isabel Magnolia and Farlan Church before Erwin Smith recruits him into the Survey Corps.


== Conception and development ==
Before Suruga began the manga, her editor-in-chief suggested that she visit the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel so she could better visualize the Underground where Levi and the others live at the beginning of the story. It was while there that Suruga was first able to picture how large an 18-meter tall Titan actually would be.[vol. 1]: 162 While drawing Levi, Suruga attempted to make him appear younger than he does in Attack on Titan. She noted that his lack of emotiveness made it difficult to choose which expressions to give him while drawing.[vol. 1]: 182  With Isabel, Suruga attempted to convey a "lively, energetic" character who, while "very cute", was just as capable at fighting Titans as anyone else.[vol. 1]: 183  Suruga had difficulty drawing Farlan's face, as she wanted to give him characteristics that would clearly distinguish him from the other two main characters. Despite that, she found it surprisingly easy to copy the character's hairstyle from Namaniku ATK's original design.[vol. 1]: 184

Noting Levi's status as a fan-favorite character, she wrote: "I often wonder at how much of the backstory in these spin-offs was the result of the original author's notes or the spin-off writer responding to the desires of the fanbase." She also commented that the art is "handled by someone other than the author, which means that characters are actually well proportioned and the perspective is solid."
