== Plot ==
Poyopoyo revolves around a spherical orange cat named Poyo, and the family that adopts him. The slice of life stories only have very mild continuity between them, and can be taken as stand-alone episodes. Episodes often deal with regular day-to-day interactions between family members, occasionally showing how family members celebrate holidays or deal with everyday inconveniences like rainstorms. At first, younger brother Hide dislikes Poyo, but as the stories continue, we see that Hide has grown somewhat attached to the family pet.
