Battle Stage is a compilation of every major street race of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Stage with the special addition of the never before seen battle between Keisuke's FD and Seiji's Evo IV. All the races from Stage 1 were redone using the newer, more detailed CG technology featured in Third Stage.

== Initial D: Battle Stage 2 (2007) ==
Battle Stage 2 is a compilation of races from 4th stage including never before seen battles between Keisuke's FD versus Smiley Sakai's DC2 Integra Type R, and Keisuke's FD versus Atsuro Kawai's ER34 (R34 GTT).

Iketani, now an improved street racer, yet again had a chance meeting with Mako, who gives Iketani another chance to meet with her where they first met.
Two guys in a black Altezza challenge Mako and Sayuki in a race where they realize that the two girls are no small-time racers.
Iketani is ready to meet with Mako as he waits for her when something happens that again results in Iketani not being able to meet Mako at the correct time. The two do meet up, after Mako picks Iketani up when he suffers a punctured tire.
Iketani, when hearing of Mako's possible future, withholds his feelings so that Mako can make "the right decision".
Mako makes her decision to go Pro for a year, but not without giving Sayuki, as well as Mount Usui, the run of their lives.
At the end, after the credits, it is stated that Mako and Iketani never meet again.
