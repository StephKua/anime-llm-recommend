The Kindaichi Case Files (Japanese: 金田一少年の事件簿, Hepburn: Kindaichi Shōnen no Jikenbo) is a Japanese mystery manga series based on the crime solving adventures of a high school student, Hajime Kindaichi, the supposed grandson of the famous (fictional) private detective Kosuke Kindaichi. Written by Yōzaburō Kanari or Seimaru Amagi (depending on series) and illustrated by Fumiya Satō, the Kindaichi series was serialized in Kodansha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Magazine from October 1992 to October 2017, spanning a total of 76 tankōbon volumes. It is one of the earliest works in the mystery manga genre. In North America, the series was published in English by Tokyopop with the title The Kindaichi Case Files. Only the first 17 volumes (the first series) were released by Tokyopop.
The series was adapted by Toei Animation into a feature film in 1996 and a 148-episode anime television series broadcast from 1997 to 2000. The series was also adapted into a live-action film, five live-action drama series, three live-action television specials and further animated features for cinema and television. A second 47-episode anime television series adaptation, titled The Kindaichi Case Files R (Returns), was broadcast from 2014 to 2016.
Another manga series, 37 Year Old Kindaichi Case Files, was serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Evening from January 2018 to February 2023, and is set to continue on Comic Days manga app. It is set 20 years later, in which Hajime graduates high school, and becomes a manager of a PR firm, but is swung back into mysteries, despite quitting detective work.
In 1995, The Kindaichi Case Files won the 19th Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen. By June 2019, the manga had over 100 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series.


== Overview ==
Kindaichi mysteries are whodunnit stories featuring (usually multiple) gruesome murders, often with a supernatural tinge. Frequently features a locked room mystery or other crimes, such as a murder occurring when all surviving suspects have (apparently) airtight alibis.
A notable distinction of The Kindaichi Case Files is that the killers are not depicted as psychopathic murderers and the murders are never committed for financial reasons alone. The identified killers all have deep rooted problems, often involving great emotional trauma through the greed or thoughtlessness of others, as their reasons for committing the murder(s). Thus the killers are often portrayed as sympathetic figures, as opposed to cold, calculating killers in some other mystery series.
In addition to this, after being revealed the criminal usually attempts suicide.
