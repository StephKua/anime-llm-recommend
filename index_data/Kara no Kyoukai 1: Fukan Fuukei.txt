== Plot ==


=== Story and setting ===
Set in Japan predominantly during the late 1990s, The Garden of Sinners follows the story of Shiki Ryougi (両儀式, Ryōgi Shiki), a teenage girl raised as a demon hunter who acquired the "Mystic Eyes of Death Perception" after surviving a fatal accident. 
It also chronicles Mikiya Kokutou's unwavering efforts to get closer to her when they were still high school students and their adventures later on in dealing with supernatural cases as investigators for Touko Aozaki's detective agency, Garan no Dou.
This is set in an alternate universe to Tsukihime and Fate/stay night; in which it serves as the prototype for both series as well as introducing many of the concepts prevalent within the latter two. In particular the main protagonist, Shiki Ryougi, possesses similar abilities as Tsukihime's protagonist, Shiki Tohno. Touko Aozaki's sister, Aoko Aozaki, is also featured briefly in Tsukihime.
As one of Kinoko Nasu's earliest works, it introduces some of the most fundamental concepts in the universe of Type-Moon's works, including souls, the Akashic Record/Root, Counter Force, Magic, Magecraft, and Mystic Eyes.Both the light novel and the films are depicted in anachronical order with each chapter/film serving as part of one collective narrative.


=== Themes ===
The series deals with the paranormal and tackles mature topics such as suicide, rape, patricide, incest and murder. Its lore and story draws inspiration from various religious philosophies and psychological concepts such as multiple personalities; the Anima and animus; the nature of sin; life, death and reincarnation; and the Paradoxical nature of the Taiji.
