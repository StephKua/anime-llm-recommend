Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade their adversaries in hopes of keeping Eren and Historia safe.
In the second half of the season, the Survey Corps led by Erwin embark on a mission to retake Wall Maria, returning to the tattered Shiganshina District that was once Eren's home. The Survey Corps strive to carve a path towards victory as Eren vows to take back everything that was once his.
