Digimon Adventure tri. (Japanese: デジモンアドベンチャーtri., Hepburn: Dejimon Adobenchā Torai.) is a Japanese adventure anime film series (sometimes referred to as OVAs) produced by Toei Animation. Celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Digimon franchise, the six-part series serves as a direct sequel to the first two television series, Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02 and follows the high school years of the first eight "Digi-Destined".
The first film, Reunion, was released on November 21, 2015, and the latest, Future, was released on May 5, 2018 in Japan, simultaneously in a three-week limited release in a dozen theaters nationwide, along with a limited Blu-ray release and a premium digital distribution. These films were simulcast worldwide outside of Japan through Crunchyroll in the original version with subtitles on the same day as their domestic Japanese release, in an episodic format with four or five episodes each.The films were also localized with English and German dubbing for events or direct-to-video exploitation; Toei presented the project to industry professionals several years in a row, but failed to sell it to other markets. Adventure tri. received generally mixed reviews from critics.


== Plot ==
The film series is set six years after Digimon Adventure and takes place in 2005. A mysterious anomaly is causing distortions in the Real World and Digimon are being plagued by a virus that turns them hostile. These circumstances lead to the eight original DigiDestined being reunited with their partner Digimon. Joined by a mysterious DigiDestined named Meiko Mochizuki and her partner Meicoomon, they are set to solve the mystery of the infected Digimon and deal with the responsibility of growing up.


== List of films ==
The films were streamed outside Japan in the original language with subtitles on the same day they were released domestically, divided into four or five episodes each. The theme song for the original Japanese version is "Butter-Fly (tri. version)" by Kōji Wada, while the English version has the theme song titled "Digimon Are Back (Again!)", performed by John Majkut. The reason of this change is because of licensing issues. The Japanese version's theme song was later kept in the sixth and final part.

=== Critical reception ===
Jacob Chapman of Anime News Network gave the first part, Reunion, a B rating. In his review, he praised the film for its production values and heartwarming fanservice to old-school Digimon fans but noted that very little happens during the first film. He also criticized the episodic format used for streaming, feeling the "episodes" were split up at awkward points in the story due to the film's slow pacing. In his review of the English dub, Chapman described it as an "incredible nostalgia bomb" and praised the performances of the returning cast members. However, he acknowledged that some of the new voice actors had to acclimate to their roles and felt that Vic Mignogna's distinctive voice and extensive anime resume hurt his portrayal of Matt. Chapman also noticed that while the dub featured localized names and a new opening theme, the script remained faithful to the original Japanese version.For the second film, Determination, Chapman gave a B+ rating. In his review, he praised Mimi and Joe's character development, noting that it was done without neglecting the rest of the cast. He also appreciated the plot twist ending. However, he criticized the drop in animation quality and the lack of combat scenes in comparison to the previous installment. For the third film, Confession, Chapman gave an A rating. In his review, he praised the writing for all the characters as well as the themes exploring the complexity of adolescence. He also notes that the production values have improved from the previous two films. However, he criticized again the animation quality and the lack of combat scenes.  For the fourth film, Loss, Chapman gave a C rating. In his review, he found the story to be compelling despite the flawed execution of the plot. He criticized the writing for Sora's character development and felt that her conflict with Biyomon was contrived. Moreover, he was disturbed by Gennai's behavior towards Sora and Meiko. Overall, he noted a drop in animation and production values but praised the animation quality of the combat scenes.Writing for the French newspaper Le Monde, Yonathan Bartak describes Digimon Adventure tri. as the creation of a "stakhanovist producer who prioritizes quantity over quality, employing animators with too little time, and an outsourced universe", journalist Benjamin Benoit speaks about a foreseeable disappointment "Failed animations, stammering rhythm, an almost non-existent scenario, the whole is reminiscent of the worst moments of the first episodes of the original series."Writing for Anime News Network, Michael Basile stated that Adventure tri. was failure and a production with a deceptively mature approach after its brief shocking moments, "Drifting away from a group of friends, being unable to let go of the past, having to think about your future and the sacrifices you need to make to achieve your dream – all of these are interesting ideas that are perfect for a Digimon story to explore, but each one gets dropped before it reaches a satisfying conclusion in favor of an ever-complexifying plot and enough technobabble to make Serial Experiments Lain sound simple by comparison.."Writing for Den of Geek, Shamus Kelley cited Adventure tri. as a failure, criticizing the writing style and convoluted resolutions, the excessive fan service, the use of characters only to "spouting off pointless anime platitudes," and its lack of ambition and innovation, "It feels like every movie in this series was made independent of each other. Sure there are cool scenes and moments in all of the films but when viewed as a whole they don’t thematically tie together. They don’t even emotionally tie together."
