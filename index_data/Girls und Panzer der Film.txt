== Plot ==
In a friendly exhibition match, Ōarai Girls' Academy join forces with a reckless Chihatan Gakuen against the combined forces of St. Gloriana Girls' College and Pravda Girls' High School. The match ends in favor of St. Gloriana and Pravda, and the participating students spend time in a bath afterward. Upon their return to the school, Ōarai students are informed by student council president Anzu Kadotani about the school's closure after the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology denounced their verbal agreement of keeping it open despite their win against Kuromorimine Girls' High School. A plane from Saunders University High School arrives to retrieve Ōarai's tanks for safekeeping as the students prepare to vacate the aircraft carrier that houses the school.
Anzu visits the Japan Senshadō Federation along with Ōarai's instructor Ami Chōno to protest the closure. With the help of Miho and Maho's mother Shiho Nishizumi, who wants a rematch for Kuromorimine, they convince the Ministry to sign an agreement to reopen Ōarai's school once they win the annihilation match against Hand-picked University Team commanded by Alice Shimada. On the day of the match, Kuromorimine, Saunders, Pravda, St. Gloriana, Anzio Girls' High School, Keizoku High School, and Chihatan join Ōarai to increase their numbers against the opponent's thirty tanks.
Kuromorimine and Pravda capture a hill to provide support to their allies atop but are bombarded by Karl-Gerät's shells. Ōarai's Turtle and Duck teams, Anzio, and Keizoku join forces to destroy Karl. The remaining tanks of Ōarai and its allies arrive at an abandoned amusement park and use its attractions to eliminate the majority of Hand-picked University tanks, turning the tide in their favor. However, Alice eventually joins the fight and disables most of her opponent's tanks. With a total of three tanks remaining in the match, the Nishizumi sisters work together to confront Alice in a heated battle that ends with Ōarai's victory. Following the match, all the girls are traveling back to their respective schools, with Ōarai students sailing back to their aircraft carrier.

=== Critical response ===
Nick Creamer of Anime News Network graded Girls und Panzer der Film "A−", feeling that the film "wraps up all of its actual plot into a concise twenty minute interlude, mixing that with some goofy comedy courtesy of Miho's friends and a little more character work for the original series' underserved squads". He praised Mizushima's direction, the film's second half that had "one of the most impressive and entertaining battle scenes you could imagine", how a huge ensemble of characters earned their moments, and the CG animation. Writing for Otaku USA, Paul Thomas Chapman felt that the film had "full of masterfully executed action set pieces and comedic beats". Ian Wolf of Anime UK News gave the film 8 out of 10, praising some of its comedic moments and the camerawork. Despite that, he found the film a "'plucky underdog' dog film [that] you can guess how most of the plot is going to turn out" and some of the 3D animation unfitting.

Two days after the premiere of Girls und Panzer der Film, the official Twitter account of the Girls und Panzer franchise reported the people had rowdily trespassed Ōarai Golf Club in Ibaraki Prefecture after its golf course was featured in the film.
