Macross Frontier (マクロスF(フロンティア), Makurosu Furontia) is a Japanese anime television series and the third Japanese anime television series set in the Macross universe. It was broadcast on MBS from April 4, 2008 to September 26, 2008.
Macross Frontier is the story of a human space colony fleet trying to find a habitable planet near the center of the Milky Way. The story focuses on three young adults (a famed pop singer, a private military pilot, and a rising pop singer) and the events that occur around them as the fleet faces a crisis of alien origin.


== Plot ==

The series features the 25th New Macross-class Colonial Fleet, dubbed the Macross Frontier, en route to the galactic center. This heavily populated interstellar fleet (consisting of numerous civilian vessels and their military escorts) contains a makeup of both human occupants and their Zentradi allies. As such, many of the Macross Frontier's companion vessels appear to merge more metallic Human designs with organic Zentradi aesthetics. Macross Frontier's plot explores a combination of action/political intrigue/space drama more than previous Macross series have done in the past.
As the series begins, during a mission to an unexplored asteroid belt a reconnaissance New U.N. Spacy (N.U.N.S.) VF-171 is destroyed by extremely powerful and fast insectoid biomechanical alien mecha known as the "Vajra" which immediately begin their attack on the rest of the fleet. Unable to stop the new enemy threat, the N.U.N.S. Colonial Defense Forces authorizes the deployment of a private military provider organization called S.M.S. (Strategic Military Services) which utilizes the new VF-25 Messiah variable fighter to combat the alien menace.

==== Macross Fufonfia ====
Macross Fufonfia is a series of Flash-based 90-second promotional shorts developed by Satelight and sponsored by Mainichi Broadcasting System where characters from Macross Frontier are portrayed as office ladies and employees at the "Frontier Software Company". While not exactly standard anime, more a sort of paper cut-out animation, these ONA shorts are a fun spoof of the original series intended to promote the show. The series was aired in 2007 and featured 20 episodes.


==== Macross Frontier the Movie: The False Songstress ====
A theatrical version of the Macross Frontier anime television series was announced in Japan during the broadcast of the 25th and final episode "Your Sound" ("Anata no Oto") on September 25, 2008. According to interviews with Shōji Kawamori the movie was to be an adaptation of the story from the television series. Japanese anime magazine Animedia had originally announced that the film was to be released during the summer of 2009. Other reports later placed the premiere in the fall of 2009. That report was confirmed by an itasha (vehicle decorated with character art) mini-van outside the "Macross: The Super Dimension Space Launching Ceremony" event that took place on February 22, 2009 in Japan. However, at that point, the creator Shoji Kawamori and the cast members Yuuichi Nakamura (Alto Saotome), Aya Endo (Sheryl Nome), and Megumi Nakajima (Ranka Lee) noted on the actual event, that the new date and the title were still subjected to changes.The theatrical film adaptation of Macross Frontier opened in Japan on November 21, 2009, under the name Macross Frontier the Movie: The False Songstress (劇場版 マクロスF 虚空歌姫 〜イツワリノウタヒメ〜, Gekijōban Makurosu Furontia Itsuwari no Utahime). The Kadokawa Cineplex and Shochiku Multiplex theaters' websites revealed the title and date, and the second issue of Kadokawa Shoten's Macross Ace magazine eventually published the details on June 26, 2009. The teaser trailer for the film premiered in Japanese theaters on June 27, 2009 (the same day ticket pre-sales began in Japan). The first movie retells the events of the anime from episodes 1 to 13, with significant alterations to the story and timeline of the television series.A Blu-ray Disc release of the movie, titled Macross Frontier The Movie: The False Songstress Hybrid Pack, was released on October 7, 2010. The Blu-ray release contains the Blu-ray jacket, the hybrid disc, a 48-page artwork booklet, a theatrical release archive, and a card featuring frames from the movie. The pack also included a code that allowed the owner to be entered into a contest to attend the Macross F Christmas Live event that year. A PS3 game titled Macross Trial Frontier is included in the Hybrid Pack, playable on the PlayStation 3. A standard DVD was also released in the same day. Later Namco Bandai (now Bandai Namco Holdings) released the Macross Frontier the Movie 30th d Shudisuta b Box on May 15, 2014.


==== Macross Frontier the Movie: The Wings of Farewell ====
The official website of the Macross Frontier anime series has confirmed that there will be two theatrical Macross Frontier films. While The False Songstress primarily reedited footage from the show's initial 13 episodes, the second film, titled Macross Frontier the Movie: The Wings of Farewell (劇場版 マクロスF 恋離飛翼 〜サヨナラノツバサ〜, Gekijōban Makurosu Furontia Sayonara no Tsubasa), diverges significantly from the events of the television series, featuring entirely new animation and new music. In the Macross Frontier Girasama Festival, the movie's release date is confirmed to be on February 26, 2011. The Wings of Farewell provides an original story and an alternate conclusion to Frontier, following directly off of The False Songstress.
Blu-ray and DVD editions of the movie were released by Bandai Namco Games on October 20, 2011. The Blu-ray version is still a Hybrid Pack, the same as the first movie released in Blu-ray. A PS3 game titled Macross Last Frontier is included in the Hybrid Pack, and it can be played when the disc is in the PlayStation 3. Later, Namco Bandai (now Bandai Namco Holdings) released the Macross Frontier the Movie 30th d Shudisuta b Box on May 15, 2014.

People who purchased the first pressings of either Macross Zero or Macross Frontier received a unique code to enter into the website and therefore be able to watch the short film of the respective anime.
