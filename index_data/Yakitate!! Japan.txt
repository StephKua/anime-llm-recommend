== Plot ==

Kazuma Azuma is a boy on a quest to create "Ja-pan", a national bread for Japan, as many other countries have their own signature breads. He heads to Tokyo with the intention of working at the famous bread-making chain Pantasia. Along the way, he meets other bakers, both learning from and competing against them. The characters bake their bread using their burning passion and even anger, similar to the legendary Kanjitake (河内 恭) cooking style of Hokkaido. Besides a desire to create Ja-pan, Azuma also possesses legendary Hands of the Sun (太陽の手, Taiyō no Te): hands that are warmer than typical, prompting dough to ferment faster. While this gives him an advantage early on, his innovation is his greater talent.
