The eighth generation (Generation VIII) of the Pokémon franchise features 96 fictional species of creatures introduced to the core video game series, including 89 in the 2019 Nintendo Switch games Pokémon Sword and Shield as of version 1.3.0 and 7 further species introduced in the 2022 Nintendo Switch game Pokémon Legends: Arceus. The temporary Dynamax and Gigantamax transformations were also introduced. The Pokémon Sword and Shield starter Pokémon were the first Pokémon of the generation to be revealed on February 27, 2019.
A notable change in the eighth generation compared to previous ones is that new Pokémon and forms were introduced via game patches rather than new games.


== Design and development ==
The development of Pokémon Sword and Shield began in 2016, immediately following the development period of Pokémon Sun and Moon. The conceptual phase lasted approximately a year, and the debugging process continued into 2019. With the Galar region based in Great Britain, some of the native Pokémon draw inspiration from British fauna, folklore, and mythology. The legendary Pokémon Zacian and Zamazenta resemble real-world wolves, drawing inspiration from wolves that frequently appear in British mythology. Shigeru Ohmori, the director for Sword and Shield, stated that the design team keeps a Pokémon's habitat in mind when coming up with its design so as to make the Pokémon believable.Pokémon Legends: Arceus introduces the Hisui Region, based on the real-world Japanese island of Hokkaido. The Hisui Region is a reimagining of the Generation IV games' Sinnoh Region set in the past prior to the events of those games.
Like the previous generation, redesigned versions of previously released Pokémon ("Galarian Forms" and "Hisuian Forms") were included alongside brand-new creatures.
For the first time, many new Pokémon and regional forms were added to the generation through game patches rather than through the release of a new game. Acquiring these Pokémon requires purchasing an add-on downloadable content pass separate from the base game or utilizing the in-game trade feature. Further patches added other new species, including legendary and mythical Pokémon Kubfu, Urshifu, and Zarude in June 2020 and Regieleki, Regidrago, Glastrier, Spectrier, and Calyrex in October 2020.
