Baccano! is a light novel series written by Ryohgo Narita and illustrated by Katsumi Enami. The series, often told from multiple points of view, follows many loosely connected people brought together by immortality.

Daewon C.I. licensed the Korean-language release of the series in South Korea and releases the novels under their Newtype Novels imprint.
