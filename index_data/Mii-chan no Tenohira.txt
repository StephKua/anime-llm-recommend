Magic Bus, Inc. (株式会社マジックバス, Kabushiki-gaisha Majikku Basu) is a Japanese animation studio headquartered in Nishi-Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. The company was founded in April 1972 by producer and director Satoshi Dezaki, and the studio's first work was Shin Kyojin no Hoshi in 1977. In 1983, with Dezaki directing, Magic Bus collaborated in the animation production of Captain. Magic Bus has since become largely an animation subcontractor for other animation studios.
