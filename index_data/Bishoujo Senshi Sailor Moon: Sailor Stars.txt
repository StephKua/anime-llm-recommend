Sailor Moon Sailor Stars, or simply Sailor Stars, is the fifth and final season of Sailor Moon, a Japanese magical girl anime series based on the Sailor Moon manga series by Naoko Takeuchi; the season was directed by Takuya Igarashi and produced by Toei Animation. Like the rest of the Sailor Moon series, it follows the adventures of Usagi Tsukino and her fellow Sailor Guardians. The season is divided into two story arcs, with the first 6 episodes consisting of a self-contained arc exclusive to the anime in which the Sailor Guardians encounter Queen Nehelenia again. The remaining 28 episodes adapt material from the "Stars" arc of the manga, in which the Sailor Guardians meet up with the Sailor Starlights, led by Princess Kakyuu. They discover that Sailor Galaxia, the leader of the "Shadow Galactica" organization and a corrupted Sailor Guardian, plans to increase her powers and rule the Milky Way.The season began broadcasting on TV Asahi on March 9, 1996 and ended on February 8, 1997 for 34 episodes. It was later released on DVD in six compilations with five episodes, by Toei, from September 26 to November 21, 2005. Sailor Stars was not dubbed during the intitial English-language dub of Sailor Moon in the early 2000's. In May 2014, Viz Media announced that they licensed the series from the start for an uncut release, and also that they plan to release the fifth season on Blu-ray and DVD after  Cloverway Inc. and Optimum Productions lost their licenses to the English-language adaption of Sailor Moon when they decided not to renew it. On December 14, 2015, Viz Media streamed the first episode of Sailor Moon Sailor Stars, along with the series finale of Sailor Moon SuperS, on Hulu in the United States, followed by a streaming release of the entire show on Tubi TV in Canada on July 15, 2016. The first 17 episodes of Sailor Stars were released on Blu-ray and DVD in a dual-language format on June 18, 2019. The rest were released on November 12, 2019.
