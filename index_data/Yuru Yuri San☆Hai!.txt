== Plot ==
Taking place at the fictional Nanamori Middle School in Takaoka, Toyama, the series revolves around the daily lives of the Amusement Club (ごらく部, Goraku-bu), consisting of Akari Akaza, her childhood friends, Kyōko Toshinō and Yui Funami, and her classmate, Chinatsu Yoshikawa; along with the school's Student Council which is made up of its own set of characters.


== Characters ==


=== The Amusement Club ===
Akari Akaza (赤座 あかり, Akaza Akari)
Voiced by: Shiori Mikami
Akari is a polite, fun-loving, and benevolent red-haired girl. Despite being portrayed as the main protagonist of the series, she is often overshadowed by the other characters and lacks prominence in the spotlight. She is well-known for her trademark hair buns and her unassuming presence is humorously teased by the other characters.
Kyōko Toshinō (歳納 京子, Toshinō Kyōko)
Voiced by: Yuka Ōtsubo
An optimistic and energetic blonde girl who is a year older than Akari and is the more substantial main protagonist. She has a lively personality and never passes up an opportunity for a laugh, which often involves causing Yui trouble. She has a crush on Chinatsu, who resembles her favorite anime character, Mirakurun. She is the object of affection for Ayano, the student council vice-president, who is in many ways her opposite. Despite her lazy attitude, she often gets high scores on tests after cram sessions. She enjoys eating rum raisin ice cream and is also a talented dōjin artist.
Yui Funami (船見 結衣, Funami Yui)
Voiced by: Minami Tsuda
A cool-headed girl with dark hair who often acts as the voice of reason in the Amusement Club. She is a childhood friend of Akari and Kyōko. Yui has a passion for video games and is portrayed as an exceptional cook, leaving Chinatsu enamored with her food. She is a reliable and dependable friend who lives alone in an apartment complex. Although she never openly admits it, Yui occasionally experiences a sense of loneliness, particularly when Kyōko is not around. While generally reserved, Yui can't help but burst into stifled laughter when Ayano makes puns.
Chinatsu Yoshikawa (吉川 ちなつ, Yoshikawa Chinatsu)
Voiced by: Rumi Ōkubo
Akari's pink-haired classmate. Originally interested in joining the Tea Ceremony Club, she ends up joining the Amusement Club because the former club was already disbanded. Kyōko, who has a crush on her due to her resemblance to the anime character Mirakurun, often pursues her. However, Chinatsu herself has a passionate crush on Yui, whom she looks up to and often fantasizes about. While generally cute, benevolent, and overly happy, especially in Yui's presence, she can sometimes be selfish and occasionally shows dark thoughts. Her lack of artistic skills can be quite disturbing to others and frequently leaves them horrified and in shock whenever she tries to draw something.


=== Student Council ===
Ayano Sugiura (杉浦 綾乃, Sugiura Ayano)
Voiced by: Saki Fujita
Ayano is the Student Council's vice-president, known for her uptight and high-strung demeanor. She tends to hide her true feelings for Kyōko, often referring to her by her full name and exhibiting occasional acts of hostility. However, this behavior is unintentional, as Ayano is not comfortable openly expressing her affection. Despite being a diligent student who sees herself as Kyōko's rival, Ayano is consistently outperformed by Kyōko in tests, despite Kyōko's seemingly carefree attitude. Privately, Ayano harbors romantic and affectionate feelings for Kyōko, but she perceives showing her friendly and responsive side as a weakness. While Ayano may not openly display it, she genuinely cares about those around her and is selfless, often sacrificing her time and energy for others' sake. She also inadvertently makes puns that elicit laughter from Yui. Ayano's fondness for crème caramels is evident, as she keeps one refrigerated in the Student Council's room, although it often ends up being consumed by Kyōko or Sakurako.
Chitose Ikeda (池田 千歳, Ikeda Chitose)
Voiced by: Aki Toyosaki
A member of the Student Council who is almost always seen alongside Ayano. Despite her gentle disposition, she is a passionate yuri fangirl and often imagines romantic pairings, especially involving Kyōko and Ayano. Whenever she starts fantasizing, Chitose removes her glasses, and these daydreams cause her to have near-fatal nosebleeds. As Ayano's closest friend, Chitose is fully aware of Ayano's feelings for Kyōko and actively supports their getting together, although Ayano herself is often unaware of Chitose's efforts. She speaks in a soft Kansai dialect and likes tsukemono (Japanese pickled vegetables). She has a low tolerance for alcohol and tends to go on kissing sprees whenever she gets intoxicated. In the anime, this is only portrayed through alcohol-filled chocolates, however.
Sakurako Ohmuro (大室 櫻子, Ōmuro Sakurako)
Voiced by: Emiri Katō
An enthusiastic candidate for the position of Student Council vice-president next year. She has dark blond hair and a petite build, which she has a complex about. Having been childhood friends since kindergarten, she shares a close bond with Himawari. While the two view each other as rivals and are competing for the student council vice-president role, their constant bickering and apparent animosity belie the fact that they actually consider each other as friends and share a deep affection. In terms of school work, she harbors a strong dislike and exhibits even greater laziness than Kyōko. When confronted with homework assignments, she often throws tantrums in protest.
Himawari Furutani (古谷 向日葵, Furutani Himawari)
Voiced by: Suzuko Mimori
Another candidate vying for the position of Student Council vice-president next year. She possesses navy blue hair and is well-endowed, which often leads to teasing from Sakurako, who is jealous of her early physical development. Despite her graceful demeanor, refined speech, and use of sophisticated vocabulary, she does not actually come from a wealthy background. In many ways, she is the opposite of her childhood friend Sakurako, with whom she frequently engages in arguments. However, her tendency to speak directly and aggressively only toward Sakurako reflects the deep intimacy the two share. In fact, she holds genuine affection for Sakurako and often assists her with school assignments.
Rise Matsumoto (松本 りせ, Matsumoto Rise)
Voiced by: Saori Gotō
The current student council president who has very little presence and often speaks in a whisper-quiet voice that only a few people such as Nana can understand. She is Nana's "Explosive Friend," because she always suffers the explosions she causes.


=== Family members ===
Mari Funami (船見 まり, Funami Mari)
Voiced by: Maaya Uchida
A daughter of one of Yui's relatives. She is a fan of Mirakurun, and initially mistakes Chinatsu for her, but she does not take kindly to Chinatsu after learning that her personality doesn't match her image.
Kaede Furutani (古谷 楓, Furutani Kaede)
Voiced by: Aya Uchida
Himawari's six year old sister. Kaede is shown to be quite even-tempered and wise beyond her years.
Chizuru Ikeda (池田 千鶴, Ikeda Chizuru)
Voiced by: Momo Kuraguchi
Chitose's twin sister, who looks identical to her except for eye color. Unlike her sister, Chizuru is shown to be very cold and distant towards most people, though she has a strong bond with her sibling. Much like Chitose, she often takes off her glasses to invoke yuri fantasies, pairing Ayano with Chitose and drooling instead of having nosebleeds. She strongly dislikes Kyōko, who constantly tries to play pranks on her and is seemingly a barrier against her fantasies.
Akane Akaza (赤座 あかね, Akaza Akane)
Voiced by: Yui Horie
Akari's older sister who is 19 years old and attends a university. She is secretly infatuated with Akari, with her room almost completely covered in photos of her, often doing various perverted things with her belongings when she is not around and reading many doujins about sisterly incest.
Tomoko Yoshikawa (吉川 ともこ, Yoshikawa Tomoko)
Voiced by: Ayano Ishikawa
Chinatsu's older sister. She's a friend of Akane and has strong feelings for her.
Nadeshiko Ohmuro (大室 撫子, Ōmuro Nadeshiko)
Voiced by: Chiwa Saitō
Sakurako's older sister who is eighteen years old. Like Sakurako, she also has a petite build, but she is also taller, and unlike Sakurako, she is intelligent and responsible. She is in a romantic relationship with one of her friends, though it has not yet been revealed who.
Hanako Ohmuro (大室 花子, Ōmuro Hanako)
Voiced by: Rina Hidaka
Sakurako's younger sister who is an elementary school student, and is eight years old. She acts very mature for her age, but also has some childish tendencies. Both Hanako and Nadeshiko tend to think Sakurako is lazy, abrasive and stupid, though they are shown to miss her when she's not around.


=== Others ===
Nana Nishigaki (西垣 奈々, Nishigaki Nana)
Voiced by: Ryoko Shiraishi
A faculty member at Nanamori Middle School who is constantly trying various experiments, often using Rise as a test subject and has a love for explosions, which are generally caused by her experiments. She is one of the few people who can understand Rise's quiet voice.
